                                <p>This project is a school project created by a team of four students, including myself. It focuses on developing a weather station that can collect and record meteorological data. The system is designed to operate in different modes, including standard, configuration, maintenance, and energy-saving, allowing users to customize its functionality based on their needs. Data is acquired at regular intervals and stored on an SD card for later analysis.</p>
                                <p>The weather station includes various sensors to measure parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity. It also features an LED color-coded system for easy status monitoring and error detection. Users can modify system parameters through the configuration mode, ensuring flexibility in data acquisition. Overall, the project demonstrates practical applications of embedded systems and sensor integration, offering a hands-on learning experience in electronics and programming.</p>

                                <p>I created this website only using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Why ? Because frameworks are good but I wanted to challenge myself and improve my skills. All the animations, transitions, and effects are done using CSS and JavaScript. The website is fully responsive and optimized for all devices. Feel free to explore the code on my <a href="https://github.com/En0ri4n/My-Website" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I would love to hear them!</p>
                                <p>I struggled to find a design that I liked, so I decided to create my own. I wanted something simple, clean, and visually appealing. I also wanted to showcase my skills and projects in a creative way. The color scheme, typography, and layout were all carefully chosen to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. I hope you enjoy exploring my website as much as I enjoyed building it! :)</p>
                                <p>There are multiple color schemes available, so feel free to switch between them using the color palette in the top right corner.
